# ClassConnect

**ClassConnect** is an application designed to help teachers take attendance efficiently with just a click on their mobile devices. This system integrates biometric authentication and geolocation verification to ensure accurate attendance tracking.

## Workflow

1. **Login and Channel Creation**:
   - Teachers and students open their respective interfaces of the application.
   - Upon login, a dedicated channel is created for each teacher on the WebSocket server.

2. **Student Connection**:
   - Students can join their respective teacher's channel by logging in.

3. **Starting Attendance**:
   - When a teacher clicks on the "Start" button, all connected students on that channel will receive a signal indicating the start of the attendance session.

4. **Biometric Authentication**:
   - An interface will open on the students' devices, prompting them to authenticate themselves using their biometric data (e.g., fingerprint).

5. **Geolocation Check**:
   - The student's geolocation is captured to ensure they are within a specified radius of the teacher.

6. **Attendance Marking**:
   - If a student successfully authenticates their biometrics and is within the defined radius, their data is stored in the session database, and they are marked as present.

7. **End of Session Report**:
   - When the teacher clicks the "Stop" button, a report of all students marked present during the session is generated from database and provided to the teacher.

## System Architecture
The system architecture can be divided into three major phases: 
1. **Client Connection and Session Initialization**:

3. **Session Closure and Report Generation**:

The project is deployed on **Azure** under the resource group `ClassConnect`. The following are the key components of the architecture:

1. **WebSocket Server**: Handles communication between teachers and students (named as **student** on Azure) .
2. **Flask Servers**: Hosts the Flask applications (named as **flask-servers** on Azure).
3. **MySQL Database Server**: Manages session data and stores attendance records (named as **classconnect-database** on Azure).
